# Marketing-Management-Database-Project
First Year, or 2nd Semester, project on creating a database system and Windows Application Program for a study case on Marketing Manager of PT LIF Indonesia.

This project was performed by a team of 8 students as a condition for graduating two courses, Database System and Visual Programming. I was responsible for connecting the database from Microsoft SQL Server to the C# Visual Studio program that was both created by my team. I'm also responsible for UI design of the program to bring a good User Experience.
