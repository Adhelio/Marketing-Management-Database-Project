# Marketing Management Database Project
This project was performed by a team of 8 students as a condition for graduating two courses of the 2nd Semester, Database System and Visual Programming. I was responsible for developing the database with Microsoft SQL Server as well as programming of the application with C# Visual Studio. I'm also responsible for UI layout and design theme of the program to bring a good User Experience and pleasing to see.
